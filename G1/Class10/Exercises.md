# Exercises for identifying and enhancing C# skills üí™
___


### 1. Collect the inputs
Write a console application that will ask the user to input 5 different type of inputs. If the user successfully add the values, display them in the console, 
else provide him an appropriate message thate he is doing something wrong.

### 2. Return name of month üóìÔ∏è
As the user to enter a number from 1-12, and print the month name correcponding to that number:  
Examples:  
3 ‚ûû "March"  
12 ‚ûû "December"  
6 ‚ûû "June"  
When the user enters anything else that is not a number from 1 to 12, write "Error, incorrect value", and ask the user to enter a proper value.


### 3. Flip the boolean üôÉ
Create a method that will accept boolean parameter as input. The method should return also boolean but it needs to swap the value of the inserted input parameter.
Ask the user to enter true or false. When he enters "true", call the method that will flip the boolean and write false in the console. When the user enters "false", call the method that will flip the boolean and write true in the console. When the user enters anything else, write "Error, incorrect value", and ask the user to enter true or false.

### 4. Multiple of 100 ‚úñÔ∏è
Ask the user to enter a number. When the number the user enters, is divisible by 100, print "You have entered a cool number!", otherwise print "The number you've enterd is not cool at all!" in the console. When the user enters anything else that is not a number, write "Can't you read? Enter a number, not anything else!", and ask the user to enter a proper number. Make sure you use method for providing the result. 


### 5. The Farm Problem üêî
Create a consoel application that will help a farmer to count how many legs he has among all his animals(enter each value one by one via the console readline). The farmer breeds three species:
chickens = 2 legs
cows = 4 legs
pigs = 4 legs
The farmer has counted his animals and he gives you a subtotal for each species. You need to print out the total number of legs of all the animals.  
Examples:  
(2, 3, 5) ‚ûû 36  
(1, 2, 3) ‚ûû 22  
(5, 2, 8) ‚ûû 50  
Notes:  
Create a method that will accept an inputs that will be numbers of animals in the given order as:  
- chickens,   
- cows,  
- pigs.  
**Remember that the farmer wants to know the total number of legs and not the total number of animals.**

### 6. Word count üññ
Create a console app that when entered a string you print out the word count. The string will be a sentence.
Examples:
"Just an example here move along" ‚ûû 6
"This is a test" ‚ûû 4
"What an easy task, right" ‚ûû 5
**Notes:
Remember how we did this in JavaScript? Don't worry, it's very similar :)**

### 7. Academy 
Create a class and give it a name of Academy. It should have the following properties:  
* Name  
* Location  
* Capacity  
* Groups - list of Groups  
* Rating  
Create a class of Group with the following properties  
* Name  
* List of Students  
* Number of students - a property that should not be accessible from outside. This property should be set in the constructor of the Group class, by using a method that will get the numbers of Student's list value   
Create a class of Student with the following properties:
* FirstName  
* LastName  
* Favourite subject  

**Make sure to create constructors for each of the classes** 

### 8. Try your LINQ skills
Copy the following code in order to setup the lists.

public static List<Artist> Artists { get; set; }  
public static List<Album> Albums { get; set; }  
public static List<Song> Songs { get; set; }
