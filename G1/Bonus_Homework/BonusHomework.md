1. Check balance
* If the user choose option 1, than a message "You have $$ on your account."
2. Withdraw money
* If the user choose option 2, than you should ask him what amount of money he/she needs.
    * After input the amount, if the amount is smallar than the balance a message should appear like "You have successfully withdrawn $$ and you left $$$ on your account".
    * If the amount is bigger than the balance, a message should appear like "You cannot withdraw $$ because your balance is $$$. Please try again with appropriate amount!"

**Bonus**
* Try and validate all the user inputs so that if wrong input is entered you will provide an error message

If he enters N, then quit the program, otherwise return him to the start of the program where the two options are displayed: Check balance or withdraw money
