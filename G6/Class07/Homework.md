# Homework Class 7 📒

## Task 1
Create a class Shape that has:

* Name
* Color
* Position, array of x and y coordinates (int[])
* getArea - method that will only write in the console that there is no special implementation for area
* getPerimeter - method that will only write in the console that there is no special implementation for perimeter *add method move that is shared among all instances and can be accessed through the class name. It updates the position of the input, by increasing the coordinates for 5.

create a setter and getter for the color and name property. The setter/getter will log a corresponding message. The setter should do validation.

* Add class Rectangle, that inherits from Shape. It should have properties sideA and sideB. Override the getArea and getPerimeter methods correspondingly for a rectangle.
* Add class Circle, that inherits from Shape. It should have property radius. Override the getArea and getPerimeter methods correspondingly for a circle.
Test with few objects.
